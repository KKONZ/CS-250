## Software Development Lifecycle

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are typically expressed in something like a product charter which, among other things, designates the vision of a product from a high level. Additionally, communication and collaborations are integral to Agile and the software development lifecycle. A product owner typically will work most directly with stakeholders and end users to distill what are the business and users need. From there these needs will get documented as user stories which express who needs the functionality, what is the funcationality needed, and why. From there developers will often write their own tasks associated with a story that includes more detail, in a self-organizing manner.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

In my career, I have used some sort of loose version of agile. My last couple jobs have included daily stand-up and used JIRA to track what people were working. It would be incredibly helpful to have someone in a product owner role in a team I work on, because often there will be conflicting opinions on priorities and functionality to add, or not add, to a product. Having someone closest to the business to help hash out the user stories and then work with the team to prioritize would be very helpful and add efficiency to the development process.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me, a good team member is someone who is helpful that strives for technical excellence and innovation. Someone who is repsectful and patient and motivates those around them.
